This is a shell of my new website that I'm building using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages.

I am a senior researcher associate at the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA) at the University of Minnesota. I study housing, neighborhoods and inequality with a focus on quantitative methods.
